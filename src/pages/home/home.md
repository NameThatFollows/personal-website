Hello there! I'm James Lu, 卢杰明 (he/him)!

I am a software engineer based in [New York City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+York,+NY/@40.6997557,-74.086227,11.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!8m2!3d40.7127848!4d-74.0059662).
I currently write software as a part of the Cloud Automation team at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

I studied Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) in [Atlanta, GA](https://goo.gl/maps/9cDs11jx2ED2), where I also helped organize hackathons, worked tech support, and dabbled in machine learning and reverse engineering.

I am passionate about urban sustainability and design and am an avid supporter of walkable cities and mass transit.
When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me exploring, traveling, cycling, playing video and board games, taking ok photos, watching dramas (with an unexpected amount of emotional investment), and reading.

If you want to chat and/or grab a bubble tea, feel free to reach out!
