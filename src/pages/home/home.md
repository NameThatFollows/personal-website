Hello there! My name is James!

I am a software developer from [Hershey, PA](https://www.hersheypa.com).
I studied Computer Science at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu) in [Atlanta, GA](https://goo.gl/maps/9cDs11jx2ED2), specializing in Intelligence and Information Internetworks.
I'm interested in urban sustainability and design, digital cartography, and automation.
At the moment, I develop software at [Bloomberg L.P.](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) in New York City.

Outside of work, I love exploring cities, cooking/eating food, drinking bubble tea, and watching movies/shows.
I also make ranking lists, such as for restaurants and movies.

I have previously worked at [Facebook](https://about.fb.com/), [Verizon Connect](https://www.verizonconnect.com/), and [HE&R](https://www.hersheypa.com/about-hershey/corporate/index.php).
At Georgia Tech, I was Director of Operations for [HackGT](https://www.hack.gt), helping to organize large and small hackathons and outreach events.
I worked tech support and residence hall network support/maintenance with the [Wreck Techs](https://techsupport.gatech.edu/).
I also worked with the Civic Data & Design project, organizing data from the City of Atlanta and area NGOs to visualize affordable housing availability and code violations over time.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or grab a bubble tea!
