Hello there! I'm James (he/him)!

I am a software engineer based in [New York City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+York,+NY/@40.6997557,-74.086227,11.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!8m2!3d40.7127848!4d-74.0059662). Right now, I am a software engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the Cloud Automation team.

I studied Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) in [Atlanta, GA](https://goo.gl/maps/9cDs11jx2ED2), where I also helped organize hackathons, worked tech support, and dabbled in robotics and machine learning.

I'm passionate about walkable cities, mass transit, and general urban sustainability and design, and most of my side projects relate to those in some way. When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me exploring, traveling, cycling, playing video and board games, taking subpar photos, and reading. I also track and rank all the food places I've been to.

If you want to chat and/or grab a bubble tea, feel free to reach out!
