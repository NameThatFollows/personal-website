Hello there! I'm James (he/him)!

I am a software engineer based in [New York City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+York,+NY/@40.6997557,-74.086227,11.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!8m2!3d40.7127848!4d-74.0059662).
I graduated from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) in [Atlanta, GA](https://goo.gl/maps/9cDs11jx2ED2) with a B.S. in Computer Science.
Right now, I work full time as a software engineer at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

My interests lie in digital cartography and procedural generation.

I'm also interested in urban sustainability and design, particularly in walkable communities and public transportation.

If you want to grab a bubble tea or just chat, feel free to reach out anytime!
