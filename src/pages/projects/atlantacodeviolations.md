A set of dynamic map-based visualizations of Atlanta code violations.

These visualizations display code violation data from the City of Atlanta and partners in Block-by-Block, an organization based in the English Avenue neighborhood of Atlanta.

A collection of code violations can often be signs of larger, systemic issues within a city and a neighborhood. Within English Avenue, we see a pattern of absentee and negligent landlords that have let properties deteriorate while they speculate on land values.

Block-by-Block began documenting these code violations and tracking these properties over time starting in 2016 as a way to formally document the current conditions and advocate to the City of Atlanta for attention and resources.

These visualizations serve as one of these ways we can bring attention to these neglected neighborhoods and raise the quality of life in our cities.

These visualizations were created using React and Mapbox along with data from Block-by-Block and the City of Atlanta that was heavily sanitized using Python scripts.
