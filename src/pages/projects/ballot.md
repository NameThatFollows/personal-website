A web-based judging solution for hackathons.

Ballot allows hackathon organizers to get the most out of a potentially limited number of judges. Projects are assigned to judges dynamically based on a series of configurable parameters, including overall score, score range, and number of visits. Projects can also be assigned manually using the same interface, with the goal of getting each project as many judges as it needs to get an accurate ranking.

Judges can judge projects for one or many categories. They can also mark a project as busy or missing.

Expo tables are automatically assigned based on number of expos, number of table groups, and number of tables. Automatic assignment can be overriden if projects need certain tables.

Ballot was used at HackGT 5 and 6, each with 1000+ participants, 30+ judges, and 200+ projects across 2 hour-long expos.
