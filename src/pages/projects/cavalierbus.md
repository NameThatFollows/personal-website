An interactive bus map for the Hampton Roads region.

This was a project created for _SLS 3110: Technology and Sustainable Communites_ at Georgia Tech to help visualize the (often convoluted) bus routes in the region.

We worked closely with Garry A. Harris, the President of the Center for Sustainable Communities, to move Cavalier Manor, a neighborhood in Portsmouth, VA, closer to becoming an EcoDistrict.

The application itself uses Google's GTFS to display lines and routes. A user can see what service looks like on a weekday vs a weekend, and it will highlight the selected routes.
