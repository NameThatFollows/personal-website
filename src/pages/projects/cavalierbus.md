An interactive bus map for the Hampton Roads region.

This was a project created for _SLS 3110: Technology and Sustainable Communites_ at Georgia Tech to help visualize the (often convoluted) bus routes in the region.

We worked closely with Garry A. Harris, the President of the Center for Sustainable Communities, whose goal was to improve the quality of life for residents of Cavalier Manor, Portsmouth, VA, and to qualify the neighborhood for [EcoDistrict](https://ecodistricts.org/) certification.

The web application uses Google's GTFS to display lines and routes. A user can compare weekday, weekend, and holiday routes. A user can also see full bus routes by either selecting the route on the map or picking from the full list.
