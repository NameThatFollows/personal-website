An Electron application written to allow HackGT organizers to clock-in to events and general meetings with a tap or swipe of their student IDs.

Graphical clock-in uses colorful, full-screen status screens with sound (heavily inspired by [Ventra readers in Chicago](https://youtu.be/X0HrYB9zoME?t=9)) to provide a full self-service experience.

This integrates with Georgia Tech's OrgSync and Engage platforms (through non-public APIs) to monitor and track attendance for meetings and events.

Due to privacy concerns, I cannot provide the source code.
