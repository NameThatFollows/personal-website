An Electron application written to allow HackGT organizers to "clock-in" to general meetings and events with a tap or swipe of their student ID.

Graphical clock-in uses colorful, full-screen status screens with sound (heavily inspired by [Ventra readers in Chicago](https://youtu.be/X0HrYB9zoME?t=9)) to provide a full self-service experience.

This integrates with Georgia Tech's OrgSync and Engage platforms (through non-public APIs) to monitor and track attendance for meetings and events.
It accepts inputs from RFID scanners or a card swipe readers to support both new and old IDs.
