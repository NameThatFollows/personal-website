A self-service portal for Hershey High School National Honor Society members, officers, and advisors.

This portal allows Hershey's NHS members to access their tracked service hours, yearly requirements, event signups, important forms, and other important information.

Officers and advisors can edit website content, add/edit/remove event signups, and service hours for each member.

This website has been used by 600+ students since initial launch and is still currently being used in production.

The source of truth for the site is stored separately from the internal database for simplicity. Similarly, passwords are stored in plain text since the site stores no sensitive information.
