A self-service web application for Hershey High School NHS members, officers, and advisors.

This website allows for members of Hershey High School's National Honor Society to access accumulated service hours, requirements, event signups, important forms, and FAQs.

Officers and advisors can edit website content, add/edit/remove events, and service hours for members. This consolidated previously all-paper records into a single location.

This website has been used by 600+ students since initial launch and is still currently being used in production.

Note: This was originally developed in August 2015 with less-than-ideal information management. Password management, most notably, uses a student's ID # by design and thus is not stored securely.
